# Widgets repo

*A project from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/learn/lecture/12531408#content) I'm working on to learn react and redux*

## Widgets

 - Wikipedia API Search tool
 - Dynamic dropdown component
 - Google translate widget

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a lot about state and how React works. Having to learn how to implement routing (done by manually creating an event and allowing your components to listen for it, allowing for a rerender along with changing the url of the browser simultaneously) along with learn how axios calls can be customised to have baseURLs and params.
